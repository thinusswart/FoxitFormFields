# FoxitFormFields
 
This is a sample application that demonstrates how to add fillable text fields to any PDF file. 

The application uses a trial version of the Foxit PDF SDK, which is not included in this repository because of licensing.

You can apply for your own trial version of the SDK on [this link here](https://developers.foxit.com/pdf-sdk/free-trial/).
